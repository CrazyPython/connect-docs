# Overview

## Why Anvil Connect?

The problem of auth is like an iceberg. On the surface users only see the button to "sign in with Facebook" or a simple password login form. It seems like it should be easy and straightforward. Just use some library and get on with building a great app.

Auth quickly becomes more challenging when you have more than one app and you want to share user accounts and permissions. It gets worse when you want to offer users a choice of several authentication methods. Now you have a many to many problem. These challenges multiply further when you start publishing and consuming API data. Anvil Connect solves these problems by providing a single point of truth for identity and access management.



## How it works

Anvil Connect acts as a database of users, apps, services, permissions and connections to other providers. When you run the server, you also become an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect provider. That means you can share user accounts between applications and protect your APIs with JSON Web Tokens. It also means third party developers can (if you choose to allow it) build apps that authenticate using your domain.

Anvil Connect can delegate user authentication to other identity providers. Out of the box, you can authenticate users with a growing list of third parties, including AngelList, Dropbox, Facebook, Foursquare, GitHub, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, SoundCloud, Twitter, and WordPress. In addition, the server can authenticate users locally with passwords. It never stores passwords, only a hash of the password.

You can easily extend Anvil Connect to support more providers using OAuth, OAuth 2.0, OpenID 2.0, or OpenID Connect. If that isn't enough, you can integrate virtually any existing Passport strategy or write your own custom auth code. The sky's the limit.



## Getting Started

### Server

Anvil Connect is a server that runs independently of your apps and services. To start using it, you'll first need to set up your own instance. Then you can configure, customize, and deploy.

[Learn more](/docs/connect-docs/server/)

### Clients

After setting up your server, the next step is to register apps and services. Once youâ€™ve done this, you can add a library code and configure it to use your new auth server.

### Users

Your Anvil Connect server is a database for user identities. Learn how to work with users in Anvil Connect.
